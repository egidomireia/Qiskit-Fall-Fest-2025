The queens puzzle is the problem of placing the maximum number of chess queens on an $N \times N$ chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. It is often used as an example in various computational techniques. This problem does not have a unique solution, and the complexity of finding one increases exponentially with the size of $N$.
